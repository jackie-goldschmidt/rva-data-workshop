# RVA Data Workshop 2020 Intro to Data Engineering

This work was created as part of the RVA Data Summit Workshop 2020 session, "Introduction to Data Engineering."

It provides a tested, deployable REST microservice that returns a calculated value.

For information on how to work with the microservice, see specification.yaml.
